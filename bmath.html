						<h2>Getting started</h2>
						<h4>Addition</h4>
						<p>Addition is a fundamental arithmetic operation that involves combining two or more numbers to get a total. It is represented by the plus sign (+).</p>
					</header><a href="#" class="image fit">
						<img src="images/addition.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="400"></a>
					<p>The numbers that are being added are called addends, the result of the added numbers is called sum. Addition is a basic concept taught in early mathematics education and serves as the foundation for more complex mathematical operations.</p>
					<p>Understanding addition helps build essential skills for problem-solving and logical thinking, making it a crucial element in the study of mathematics.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="container">

					<header class="major">
						<h4>Subtraction</h4>
						<p>Subtraction is a fundamental operation in mathematics that involves taking away one quantity from another. It's denoted by the minus sign (-) and is used to determine the difference between two numbers or quantities. The basic idea is to find out how much is left when one amount is subtracted from another.</p>
					</header>
					<p>For example, if you have 10 apples and you give away 3 apples, you are left with 7 apples. In mathematical terms, this is written as:

						10
						−
						3
						=
						7
						</p>
					<p>Subtraction is not just limited to whole numbers; it can also be applied to decimals, fractions, and even algebraic expressions. For instance, consider the decimal subtraction of 4.5 and 2.3:

						4.5
						−
						2.3
						=
						2.2</p>
					<p>When it comes to fractions, the process involves finding a common denominator. For example, subtracting 
						3/
						4
						 from 
						5/
						4
						 would result in:
						
						5/
						4
						−
						3/
						4
						=
						2/
						4
						=
						1/
						2</p>
					<p>Subtraction is widely used in various aspects of life, such as calculating expenses, determining distances, and solving problems in science and engineering. It also plays a critical role in more complex mathematical concepts, including algebra and calculus.</p>
					<p>In algebra, subtraction is used to solve equations and inequalities. For example, if 
						𝑥
						+
						5
						=
						12
						, you can subtract 5 from both sides to find that 
						𝑥
						=
						7
						.</p>
					<p>Overall, subtraction is an essential mathematical operation that helps us understand and quantify changes and differences in various contexts.

						<h4>Multiplication</h4>
						<p>Multiplication is a core arithmetic operation that represents the process of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. It's denoted by the symbol (×) or sometimes by a dot (·) or an asterisk (*). Multiplication involves two components: the multiplicand (the number being multiplied) and the multiplier (the number of times the multiplicand is added).</p>
					</header>
					<p>For instance, if you have 4 groups of 3 apples, you can find the total number of apples by multiplying 4 by 3:

						4
						×
						3
						=
						12
						This means that you have 12 apples in total.</p>
					<p>Multiplication extends beyond whole numbers to include decimals, fractions, and algebraic expressions. For example, multiplying two decimals, such as 2.5 and 3.2, is done as follows:<br>
						2.5
						×
						3.2
						=
						8.0</p>
					<p>When it comes to fractions, multiplication is straightforward as you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. For example, multiplying 
						2/
						3
						 by 
						3/
						4
						 results in:
						
						2/
						3
						×
						3/
						4
						=
						6/
						12
						=
						1/
						2</p>
					<p>In algebra, multiplication is used to combine like terms and simplify expressions. For instance, if you have the expression 
						2
						𝑥
						×
						3
						𝑥
						, you multiply the coefficients and the variables:
						
						2
						𝑥
						×
						3
						𝑥
						=
						6
						𝑥^
						2</p>
					<p>Multiplication is a vital tool in many real-life situations, such as calculating areas (length × width), understanding proportions, and solving problems in science, engineering, and economics. It's an essential skill that underpins more complex mathematical concepts and operations.</p>
					<p>Overall, multiplication helps us quantify repeated addition and understand the relationships between different quantities.</p>

						<h4>Division</h4>
						<p>Division is a basic arithmetic operation that involves splitting a number into equal parts. It's represented by the division symbol (÷) or a slash (/). The number being divided is called the dividend, and the number you are dividing by is called the divisor. The result of the division is called the quotient.</p>
					</header>
					<p>For example, if you have 12 candies and you want to divide them equally among 4 friends, you use division:

						12
						÷
						4
						=
						3
						This means each friend gets 3 candies.</p>
					<p>Division can also be applied to decimals and fractions. For instance, dividing 9.6 by 3 looks like this:

						9.6
						÷
						3
						=
						3.2</p>
					<p>When dividing fractions, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. For example, dividing 
						1/
						2
						 by 
						1/
						4
						:
						
						1/
						2
						÷
						1/
						4
						=
						1/
						2
						×
						4/
						1
						=
						4/
						2
						=
						2</p>
					<p>In everyday life, division is useful in many situations, such as sharing, grouping items, or understanding proportions. For example, if a pizza has 8 slices and 4 people want to share it equally, each person gets:

						8
						÷
						4
						=
						2
						So, each person gets 2 slices.</p>
					<p>Division is also important in more advanced mathematics and is used in solving equations, understanding rates, and working with proportions and ratios.</p>
					<p>In summary, division helps us to understand how to evenly distribute items and solve problems related to equal sharing and grouping. It is a fundamental operation that provides a foundation for more complex mathematical concepts.					</p>

						<h4>Geometry: An Exploration</h4>
						<p>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the properties and relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and solids. It's a subject that surrounds us daily, from the shapes of buildings to the curves of a highway.</p>
					</header>
					<h4>Basics of Geometry</h4>
					<p>The foundation of geometry starts with some basic concepts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Point: An exact location in space. It has no size, only position.</li>
						<li>Line: A collection of points extending infinitely in two directions. It has length but no width or thickness.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Acute Angle: Less than 90°</li>
						<li>Right Angle: Exactly 90°</li>
						<li>Obtuse Angle: Greater than 90° but less than 180°</li>
						<li>Straight Angle: Exactly 180°</li>

𝑟
).</li>
						<li>Circumference: The distance around the circle. Given by 
𝐶
=
2
𝜋
𝑟
.</li>

					<p>Example: The area of a rectangle is given by:<br>

𝐴
=
𝑙
×
𝑤<br>
where 
𝑙
 is the length and 
𝑤
 is the width.</p>
